    Purpose
        Analyse CSPS theme scores by organisation. Carries out the following:
            - Simple linear regressions
                - Organisation-level EEI and theme scores for 2024
                - Core department organisation-level EEI and theme scores for 2024
                - CS median EEI and theme scores over time
            - Two-way fixed effects regressions
                - Organisation-level EEI and theme scores (all years)
                - Core department organisation-level EEI and theme scores (all years)
    Inputs
        - XLSX: "Organisation working file.xlsx"
            - CSPS organisation data
    Outputs
        None
    Notes
        - Analysis is not carried out on CS mean figures, as there are insufficient data points: these are only available from 2019 onwards
        - Scottish and Welsh organisations are dropped, but this only applies to organisation-level analysis and not analysis based on the CS median
        - Four organisations are dropped to avoid double-counting:
            - 'Ministry of Justice group (including agencies)': Dropped as 'Ministry of Justice' (i.e. the core department) exists as a separate organisation in the data
            - 'Ministry of Justice arm's length bodies': Dropped as individual MoJ ALBs exist as separate organisations in the data
            - 'Office for National Statistics' and 'UK Statistics Authority (excluding Office for National Statistics)': Dropped as 'UK Statistics Authority', which includes the ONS, exists as a separate organisation in the data. ONS is a sub-unit rather than a distinct organisation, therefore we want to include it as part of UKSA
        - DfE figures included in this analysis are group figures, unlike other ministerial departments (see Excel working file for further details)
        - The department-only analysis is carried out on ministerial departments plus HMRC and minus AGO, the territorial offices (reported as one entity - "Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland Offices, and the Office of the Advocate General for Scotland" - with an organisation type of "Combination" in our classification) and the Export Credits Guarantee Department, for consistency with other Whitehall Monitor analysis
        - The two-way effects regressions are a way of digging into the causality of findings. No additional work has been done to check that organisation names are standardised over time, so some time series may be broken where there are changes in naming/formatting (e.g. considering 'Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government - 2018 iteration', 'Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities' and 'Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government - 2024 iteration' a single entity). In general, there shouldn't be many trivial differences in naming/formatting as in compiling the IfG's collation of the source data we carry out cleaning of organisations names, but things like renamings are not currently handled (see 'Future enhancements' below)
    Future enhancements
        - If we wish to make greater use of the two-way effects regression findings we should carry out the work of ensuring that organisation names are standardised over time, to ensure time series are being broken by by small changes in naming/formatting
